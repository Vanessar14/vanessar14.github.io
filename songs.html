<h1>Top Five Songs From TTPD</h1>
<h2>In No Particular Order</h2>
<p> I Can Do It With A Broken Heart</p>
    <p> ICDIWABH was defitnley an immidete favorite from the album. I like it because it's super fun and upbeat and has that Mastermind vibe. </p>
<p> But Daddy, I Love Him </p>
    <p> BDILM was one the other ones that stood out to me on the first listen, one bc it one of the longer song but also because of the lyrics. </p>

<p> The Prophey </p> 
   <p> The Prophey was on the Anthegoly and was one of the last ones, so I was almost alseep during it at like 11pm. But after a few more listens, it really started to grow on me. I think it really has again, amazing lyrics, and such great vocals. </p>
