<h1>Top Five Songs From TTPD</h1>
<h2>In No Particular Order</h2>
<h3> I Can Do It With A Broken Heart</h3>
    <p> ICDIWABH was defitnley an immidete favorite from the album. I like it because it's super fun and upbeat and has that Mastermind vibe. </p>
    <p> Favortie Lyric: "I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day" </p>
<h3> But Daddy, I Love Him </h3>
    <p> BDILM was one the other ones that stood out to me on the first listen, one bc it one of the longer song but also because of the lyrics. </p>
    <p> Favorite Lyric: "I'm having his baby/ No, I'm not but you should see your faces" </p>
<h3> The Prophey </h3> 
   <p> The Prophey was on the Anthegoly and was one of the last ones, so I was almost alseep during it at like 11pm. But after a few more listens, it really started to grow on me. I think it really has again, amazing lyrics, and such great vocals. </p>
<p>Favorite Lyric: "Please/I've been on my knees/Change the prophcey"
<h3> So High School </h3>
<p> So High School, one is amazing because of how relateable it is. The bridge is my favorite part for sure and I love how she it's a little window into her life. </p>
<p> Favorite Lyric: "Truth, dare, spin bottles/You know how to ball/I know Aristole" </p>
<h3> Guilty As Sin?</h3>
<p> I really like Guilt As Sin? because I think it's the perfect repersentation of the album because it has that down beat but also has a little pep. It also has really impecable lyricism so choosing my favorite was defintley hard. </p>
<p> Favorite Lyric: "Drowning in the Blue Nile/He sent me 'Downtown Lights'/ I hadn't heard it in a while" </p>
