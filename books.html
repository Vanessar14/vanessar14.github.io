<h1>Top Fives Books</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2> Six of Crows </h2></li>
<p> Six of Crows is so good! I was never a big fan of the Shadow and Bone trilogiy, but after I started reading Six of Crows my enitre opinion on the series shifted. Six of Crows follow six different characters coming together to pull of a impossible hiest. I love each of them so much because the auother crafts such good dynamics between them and complex stories for them. Kaz is an icon, and Wes and Dylan are so cute! </p>
<li><h2> A Good Girl's Guide to Murder</h2></li>
<p> AGGGTM is one of my favorite murder mystery series becuase Pip is such an intersting character, and the plot twists are not peridctable. The first book with Andie Bell is defintley the best, but I'm so excited for the TV show with Emma Myers! </p>
<li><h2> Once Upon A Broken Heart </h2></li>
<p> If someone asks me my favorite book, this is it. I loved Carval (the pervious series), but this is so much better. Jack is such an complaicted protaganist and I love his and Evangeline. There banter is top teir and I'm so happy they ended up together </p> 
<li><h2>Better Than the Movies</h2></li>
<p> Littearly such a cute rom-com. I love the eneimes to lovers plus fake dating trope between Wes and Liz. Liz is also such a heartfelt character with her dreams and asperations </p>
<li> <h2> The Inheritance Games</h2></li>
<p> AHHHH, I love this series. All of the characters are top teir. Normally, I tend to have a favorite, but between Avery, Grayson, Jameson, and Xander I can not choose. They all have such intersting personalites and dynamics with each other. I'm also not normally a love triangle person, but the one between Avery, Grayson, and Jameson. The plot is also so intersting with all the twists and puzzles Avery and the brothers have to solve. </p>
